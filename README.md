Odysee.com Follow Bot

Basically odysee is a popular alternative to YouTube. 
I found an exploit to generate "accounts" instantly and infintely a while ago (probably back around feburary or march)
A couple months ago I shared this with @clipssender31 and sent my code, he then threaded it and added proxies. 
Anyways I got bored a couple days ago and decided to make my own version of this shit and yeah gg.

The exploit works by sending either a GET or POST request to the /user/new api endpoint. The endpoint gives an auth token that is supposed to be used to validate a new account signup put aparently they got retard monkey brains over at the odysee dev team who got fucked by a 14 year old and you can use these blank auth tokens for follows, likes, comments, refering, etc.
Fr this exploit op and ive used it for so long cant wait for it to get patched by the half brained dev team ðŸ¥³
